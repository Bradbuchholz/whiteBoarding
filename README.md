## Researching prompt 1 - turning strings to URLs
* how many spaces? 


### example
* // Given n, return the nth number (number at the position of n) of the Fibonacci Sequence where n >= 1

* // n = 7
* // 8
* // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

* // Clarifying Questions
* // What is the Fib?
* // MAy I use JS/C#?
* // What about my inputs? Always positive? Account for strings?
* // Error handling?
* // Can I use built-in methods?

* // Pseudocoding
* // Accept N, a positive integer (N >= 1) // DONE
* // Something like a loop to do this:
* // Count up to the Nth positiong using addition to get to said Nth number. // DONE
* // Add the previous two numbers together to get the next. // DONE
* // Figure out a way to keep track of these numbers to add them upp as I go. 
* // Put them in an array? (.push())
* // Figure out how to get the value at N
* // Return said value.
